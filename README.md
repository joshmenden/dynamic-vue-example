# dynamic-vue-example

> Arbitrary example displaying vue dynamic components

## Pros to Dynamic Components:

- Remove duplicate code
- Make template easily readable
- Good for "separation of responsibilities"
- Easy to debug

## Cons to Dynamic Components:
- Abstraction of Code (can be difficult to follow)
- Unecessarily large number of files

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
